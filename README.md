## Northwestern University M.S. Data Science Practical Machine Learning Course Work (MSDS_422)

The course introduces machine learning with business applications using Python. 
It provides a survey of machine learning techniques, including traditional statistical methods, 
resampling techniques, model selection and regularization, tree-based methods, support vector machines and kernel methods, 
principal components analysis, cluster analysis, artificial neural networks, and deep learning. Brandon implemented machine 
learning models with open-source software for data science to make recommendations for management decision. They explore data and learn from data, finding underlying patterns
useful for data reduction, feature analysis, prediction, and classification.
