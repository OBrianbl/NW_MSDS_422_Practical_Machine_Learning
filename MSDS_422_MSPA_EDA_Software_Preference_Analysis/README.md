## Exploratory Data Analysis

This project focuses on bringin data into Python, performing exploratory data analysis (numrical and visual).

### Background Materials

The MSPA Software Survey was collected in December 2016. Data from the survey were used to inform data science curriculum planning.
These data are provided in the comma-delimited text file <mspa-survey-data.csv>.
 

## Management Questions to Answer

Imagine that you are an academic administrator responsible for defining the future direction of the graduate program. 
The MSPA Survey has been designed with these objectives in mind:

**Learn about current student software preferences
**Learn about student interest in potential new courses
**Guide software and systems planning for current and future courses
**Guide data science curriculum planning


## Results and Recommendations

The final analysis and recommendations can be found here: [Final_Analysis_Management_Recommendation.pdf](Final_Analysis_Management_Recommendation.pdf)
