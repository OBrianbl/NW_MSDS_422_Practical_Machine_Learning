## Exploratory Data Analysis

This project focuses on bringin data into Python, performing exploratory data analysis (numrical and visual).

### Background Materials

* The MSPA Software Survey was collected in December 2016. 
* Data from the survey were used to inform data science curriculum planning.
* These data are provided in the comma-delimited text file <mspa-survey-data.csv>.
 

## Management Questions to Answer

Imagine that you are an academic administrator responsible for defining the future direction of the graduate program. 
The MSPA Survey has been designed with these objectives in mind:

* Learn about current student software preferences
* Learn about student interest in potential new courses
* Guide software and systems planning for current and future courses
* Guide data science curriculum planning


## Results and Recommendations
Looking at the overall preferences for software we see that Python and R showed the most 
preference, with SAS still hanging around as important. This is further backed when looking at 
these three software preferences per graduate year. Python and R preferences produced an 
overall highest percentage total for software preferences, with R still preferred above others; this 
could be due to the lack of familiarity with Python verses R. Then looking at which potential 
new course offering was rated the highest we see the Python Course as the top with 31.11%. 
Thus, my recommendation would be to offer more courses in Python, including Python 
programming foundations course.<br><br>

### Python Programming
**Python packages: matplotlib, numpy, os, pandas, and seaborn  
[Jupyter Notebook](MSPA_Software_and_New_Course_Preferences_EDA.ipynb)<br>
[Python Code](MSPA_Software_and_New_Course_Preferences_EDA.py)

### prepared for Python version 3x features and functions
** These two lines of code are needed for Python 2.7 only
* from __future__ import division, print_function
* from future_builtins import ascii, filter, hex, map, oct, zip
