## Exploring and Visualizing Data

This project focuses on bringing data into Python, exploring, and visualizing data to make cirriculum recommendations for the 
new data science program.

### Background Materials

The data utilized in this assignment was collected from a survey about the MSPA (NW M.S. Predictive Analytics) program, 
in December, 2016, and used to inform the direction of the data science curriculum planning.
These data are provided in the comma-delimited text file <mspa-survey-data.csv>.

## Management Questions to Answer

Imagine that you are an academic administrator responsible for defining the future direction of the graduate program. 
The MSPA Survey has been designed with these objectives in mind:


**Learn about current student software preferences
**Learn about student interest in potential new courses
**Guide software and systems planning for current and future courses
**Guide data science curriculum planning


## Results and Recommendations
