## Evaluating Classification Models

For this assignment you are asked to fit classification models to data from the Bank Marketing Study.

### Background Materials

..Use three binary explanatory variables relating to client banking history: default, housing, and loan. 
..Predict the binary response variable: 
..Has the client subscribed to a term deposit? 
..Data is presented as csv <bank.csv> 
### Employ two classification methods: 
..logistic regression 
..naïve Bayes classification
Methods were evaluated with a 10 fold cross-validation design, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve as an index of classification performance.<br> 
Python Scikit Learn is the primary environment for conducting this research.

## Management Questions to Answer

Advising the bank about machine learning methods to guide telephone marketing campaigns.
..Which of the two modeling methods would you recommend, and why?
..which group of banking clients appears to be the best target for direct marketing efforts 
(similar to those used with previous telephone campaigns)?
